"""Pure policy core — ADR-0013's ``decide()`` single source of truth.

``decide()`` answers *whether* a request gets a credential and *which* one,
with no I/O and no flow mutation. It returns a :class:`Decision` the addon
then EXECUTES (fetch the secret, render, mutate the header, fsync the audit
under the G6 ordering). Splitting the verdict from the execution is what
makes the decision logic unit-testable against the policy fixtures without
a live backend or the mitmproxy transport.

What stays OUT of here (because it is I/O or ordering-sensitive, not policy):
  * secret fetch + render (and the ``secret_unavailable`` / ``secret_fetch_error``
    / ``composite_*`` denials that only a failed fetch can produce);
  * ``audit.emit`` and its synchronous fsync (G6);
  * the BWS-notes no-binding/invalid attribution audit (an addon pre-step).

The verdict ``forward_unmodified`` means "no inject_decision event from the
header path" — the placeholder is forwarded verbatim (G5 enforcement by
omission).
